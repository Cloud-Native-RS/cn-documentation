# Pre-Installation Phase

The **Pre-Installation Phase** is the most critical step in preparing for a successful OpenShift deployment.  
Before running the installer, you must validate that your **infrastructure, networking, security, and access controls** are properly designed and ready.  

This phase ensures that your cluster will deploy smoothly, perform reliably, and meet enterprise-grade requirements.  

---

## Goals of the Pre-Installation Phase

- Assess and validate **infrastructure capacity** (compute, storage, network).  
- Ensure **networking and security prerequisites** are in place.  
- Prepare **identity and access management (IAM)** integration.  
- Provide a **readiness checklist** to avoid misconfigurations during installation.  

---

## Key Focus Areas

During this phase, you will address the following topics:

1. **Infrastructure & Capacity Requirements**  
   - Control plane and worker node sizing.  
   - Storage design and high availability.  
   - Scalability planning.  

2. **Networking & Security Prerequisites**  
   - DNS and load balancer setup.  
   - Firewall rules and ports.  
   - TLS certificates and system hardening.  

3. **Identity & Access Management (IAM) Preparation**  
   - Authentication providers (LDAP, AD, OAuth, SSO).  
   - Role-based access control (RBAC).  
   - Secrets management integration.  

4. **Readiness Checklist**  
   - A consolidated validation list to confirm environment readiness.

## Why It Matters

Most installation failures are caused by missing or misconfigured **infrastructure and prerequisites**.  
By carefully completing this phase, you reduce risks and ensure that the installation process is **repeatable, secure, and enterprise-compliant**.
