# Security Prerequisites

A secure foundation is critical for any **OpenShift deployment**.  
Before installing the cluster, the underlying infrastructure and nodes must be **hardened, patched, and integrated with enterprise security controls**.  

This section provides guidelines for **TLS, SSH access, OS hardening, and compliance readiness**.  

---

## TLS & Certificates

- TLS is required for:  
  - **OpenShift API** → `api.cluster.example.com`  
  - **Application routes** → `*.apps.cluster.example.com`  
- Options:  
  - **Self-signed certificates** – suitable for PoC/test environments.  
  - **Enterprise CA** – recommended for production (integration with corporate PKI).  
  - **Let’s Encrypt** – suitable for internet-facing dev/test clusters.  
- Certificates must include **SANs (Subject Alternative Names)** for API and application FQDNs.  
- Ensure certificate renewal/rotation processes are documented.  

---

## Secure Node Access

- **SSH configuration**:  
  - Access limited to cluster administrators only.  
  - Use **key-based authentication** (disable password login).  
  - Rotate keys regularly.  
- **Jump/Bastion Host** (recommended):  
  - Single controlled entry point to production clusters.  
  - Enables central auditing of administrator access.  
- **Audit Logging**:  
  - Ensure SSH access and sudo commands are logged and monitored.  

---

## Operating System Hardening

- **Patching**: All nodes must have the latest OS security patches applied before installation.  
- **SELinux**:  
  - Must be enabled in **enforcing** mode (required by OpenShift).  
  - Validate custom workloads for SELinux compatibility.  
- **Firewall**:  
  - Only required OpenShift ports opened (API, etcd, kubelet, ingress).  
  - Egress traffic restricted where possible.  
- **System Services**:  
  - Disable unnecessary services and daemons.  
  - Configure NTP/chrony for time synchronization.  

---

## Compliance & Integration

- **Logging & SIEM**:  
  - Plan integration with enterprise logging systems (Splunk, ELK, or OpenShift EFK stack).  
- **Vulnerability Scanning**:  
  - Validate base OS images with scanners (e.g., OpenSCAP, Clair, Trivy).  
- **Compliance Frameworks** (as applicable):  
  - CIS Benchmarks.  
  - ISO 27001.  
  - PCI DSS, HIPAA, or industry-specific standards.

## Security Readiness Checklist

✅ **TLS**  
- [ ] Certificates generated for API and application routes.  
- [ ] Certificates signed by trusted CA for production.  
- [ ] Certificate renewal process documented.  

✅ **Access Control**  
- [ ] SSH access restricted to admin accounts.  
- [ ] Password authentication disabled.  
- [ ] Bastion host configured (for production).  
- [ ] Audit logging enabled for admin actions.  

✅ **Hardening**  
- [ ] Latest OS patches applied.  
- [ ] SELinux enabled in enforcing mode.  
- [ ] Firewall configured with only required OpenShift ports.  
- [ ] Unnecessary services disabled.  
- [ ] Time synchronization configured.  

✅ **Compliance**  
- [ ] Integration with enterprise SIEM/logging systems tested.  
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning performed on base images.  
- [ ] Compliance benchmarks reviewed (CIS, PCI, HIPAA, etc.).
