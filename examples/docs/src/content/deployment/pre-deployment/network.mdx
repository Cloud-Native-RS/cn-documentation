# Networking and Security Prerequisites

Proper **networking and security configuration** is essential for a reliable and secure OpenShift deployment.  
This section covers DNS, load balancing, firewall rules, TLS, and baseline security requirements.  

---

## Networking Requirements

### DNS
- All cluster nodes must have forward and reverse DNS records.  
- OpenShift API and application routes require resolvable FQDNs.  
- Examples:  
  - `api.cluster.example.com` → OpenShift API server.  
  - `*.apps.cluster.example.com` → OpenShift Router (Ingress).  

### Cluster Networking
- Plan CIDR ranges to avoid overlaps with existing networks:  
  - **Cluster Network CIDR** (default: `10.128.0.0/14`).  
  - **Service Network CIDR** (default: `172.30.0.0/16`).  
- Ensure no conflicts with corporate/private LANs or VPNs.  
- MTU should be consistent across all nodes (important for overlay networks).  

### Load Balancing
- **API Load Balancer**:  
  - Routes external traffic to control plane nodes (`api.cluster.example.com:6443`).  
  - Must support TCP pass-through on port 6443.  
- **Ingress Load Balancer**:  
  - Routes traffic to OpenShift Routers on worker nodes (`*.apps.cluster.example.com`).  
  - Supports HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443).  
- HA requirement: Minimum of 2 load balancers for redundancy.  

### Firewall & Ports
- Required open ports between cluster components:  
  - **Control Plane**: 6443 (Kubernetes API).  
  - **Workers**: 10250 (Kubelet), 30000–32767 (NodePort).  
  - **Ingress**: 80/443 for apps.  
- Allow internal traffic between nodes on required ports.  
- Ensure egress access to Red Hat registries and update services.

## Security Prerequisites

### TLS & Certificates
- TLS certificates required for:  
  - OpenShift API (`api.cluster.example.com`).  
  - Application routes (`*.apps.cluster.example.com`).  
- Options:  
  - Self-signed (for PoC).  
  - Enterprise CA or Let’s Encrypt (production).  

### Secure Access
- SSH access to nodes should be restricted to admin users only.  
- Use key-based authentication (disable password logins).  
- Jump/bastion host recommended for accessing clusters in production.  

### System Hardening
- Apply OS security patches before deployment.  
- Configure SELinux in **enforcing** mode (required by OpenShift).  
- Align node configuration with CIS Benchmarks.

## Networking & Security Readiness Checklist

✅ **DNS**  
- [ ] Forward and reverse DNS records created for all nodes.  
- [ ] `api.cluster.example.com` and `*.apps.cluster.example.com` resolvable.  

✅ **Networking**  
- [ ] Cluster and Service Network CIDRs planned and non-conflicting.  
- [ ] MTU validated across all nodes.  
- [ ] Load balancers provisioned for API and Ingress.  

✅ **Firewall & Ports**  
- [ ] Required ports opened between control plane and workers.  
- [ ] External access to API and Router validated.  
- [ ] Egress access to Red Hat registries allowed.  

✅ **Security**  
- [ ] TLS certificates generated and validated.  
- [ ] SSH restricted to authorized users with key-based access.  
- [ ] Bastion host configured (if applicable).  
- [ ] SELinux enabled in enforcing mode.  
- [ ] OS security patches applied.

## Next Steps

With networking and security validated, proceed to the **Identity & Access Management (IAM) Preparation** phase to configure authentication, RBAC, and secrets management.
