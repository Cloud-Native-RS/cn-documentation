# Deployment Architecture

OpenShift deployment architecture defines how clusters are provisioned, managed, and scaled to meet business and operational requirements. It encompasses deployment models, strategies, infrastructure automation, disaster recovery planning, and performance optimization. By carefully designing deployment architecture, organizations ensure reliability, scalability, and maintainability of their cloud-native applications.

## Deployment Models

OpenShift supports multiple deployment models to meet diverse operational needs. Each model provides different levels of control, flexibility, and management responsibility.

**On-Premises**  
Deploying OpenShift on-premises gives organizations full control over their infrastructure, network, and security policies. This model is ideal for workloads requiring strict compliance, low-latency access, or integration with existing enterprise systems. Administrators manage the hardware, storage, and networking directly, allowing fine-grained customization and optimization.

**Cloud**  
Managed cloud deployments offer a simplified operational experience, with providers such as AWS, Azure, or GCP handling the underlying infrastructure. This model reduces the operational burden on IT teams, enables quick scaling, and provides high availability and disaster recovery features out of the box. Cloud deployments are suitable for applications that require elastic resources and global reach.

**Hybrid**  
Hybrid deployments combine on-premises clusters with cloud resources, allowing workloads to span multiple environments. This approach provides flexibility for bursting workloads to the cloud, offloading non-critical tasks, or implementing cross-region disaster recovery. Network connectivity, replication, and security policies are carefully orchestrated to ensure seamless operation across environments.

**Edge**  
Edge deployments extend OpenShift to distributed locations, bringing compute closer to end-users or IoT devices. This model reduces latency for real-time applications and supports scenarios where data must be processed locally due to regulatory or connectivity constraints.

## Deployment Strategies

The strategy chosen for rolling out applications and updates significantly impacts availability and reliability. OpenShift supports multiple deployment strategies:

**Blue-Green Deployments**  
Blue-green deployments allow for zero-downtime application updates by maintaining two identical environments. One environment serves production traffic while the other is updated. After verification, traffic is switched to the new version, minimizing service disruption.

**Rolling Updates**  
Rolling updates incrementally replace pods with new versions, ensuring that the application remains available during updates. This strategy is well-suited for continuous delivery pipelines and reduces the risk of downtime.

**Canary Deployments**  
Canary deployments release new versions to a small subset of users before wider rollout. This approach allows testing in production with minimal impact, making it easier to detect issues early and rollback if necessary.

**Rollback**  
Rollback strategies provide the ability to quickly revert to a previous application version in case of failure. OpenShift supports automated rollbacks, ensuring that service availability and stability are maintained.

## Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) enables declarative and repeatable deployments of OpenShift clusters and applications. Tools like **Terraform**, **Ansible**, and **Helm Charts** are commonly used to provision infrastructure, configure nodes, and deploy applications. **GitOps** practices allow teams to manage cluster configuration through version-controlled repositories, enabling automated synchronization and auditability.

## Disaster Recovery

Disaster recovery planning ensures business continuity during failures. OpenShift clusters implement backup strategies, automated recovery procedures, and clearly defined **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)** and **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)** metrics. Regular testing of disaster recovery plans verifies readiness and helps teams respond effectively to unexpected incidents.

## Performance Architecture

Optimizing performance is critical for meeting user expectations and resource efficiency. OpenShift supports several techniques for performance optimization:

- **Resource Optimization**: Allocating CPU, memory, and storage efficiently to avoid bottlenecks.  
- **Caching Strategies**: Implementing multi-level caching for faster response times.  
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing workloads intelligently across nodes.  
- **Performance Monitoring**: Collecting real-time metrics to detect and resolve issues proactively.  

### Scalability Patterns

OpenShift provides both horizontal and vertical scaling mechanisms. Horizontal scaling adds more nodes or pods to handle increased load, while vertical scaling increases resources allocated to existing nodes or pods. Auto-scaling enables dynamic adjustments based on demand, ensuring efficient utilization of infrastructure. Load distribution strategies ensure that traffic and workloads are balanced evenly across the cluster.

### Monitoring and Alerting

Comprehensive monitoring is essential for proactive management. OpenShift integrates metrics collection, alerting rules, capacity planning, and performance tuning. Teams can track key performance indicators, configure alerts for thresholds, and continuously optimize resource usage. This approach ensures high availability, reliability, and operational excellence across all deployment models.
