# Capabilities

OpenShift extends far beyond a container orchestration platform. With built-in
enterprise-grade features and optional add-ons, it enables organizations to
manage not only workloads, but also governance, security, and hybrid
deployments. Below are some of the most important advanced capabilities such as
**ACM (Advanced Cluster Management)**, **ACS (Advanced Cluster Security)**, and
other platform services.

## Advanced Cluster Management (ACM)

OpenShift ACM allows organizations to manage multiple Kubernetes and OpenShift
clusters across different environments (on-premises, public cloud, and hybrid).
It provides a **single pane of glass** for governance, risk management, and
policy enforcement.

- **Centralized Cluster Management** – Unified visibility into all Kubernetes
  and OpenShift clusters.
- **Governance & Compliance** – Apply policies and ensure regulatory compliance
  across environments.
- **Multi-Cluster Deployments** – Deploy and manage workloads across multiple
  clusters seamlessly.
- **Disaster Recovery Support** – Multi-cluster backup and failover planning.

> With ACM, IT teams gain control over complex, distributed environments while
> keeping operations consistent and secure.

## Advanced Cluster Security (ACS)

OpenShift ACS is focused on protecting workloads throughout their lifecycle,
from build to runtime. It integrates security directly into the development and
deployment pipelines.

- **Vulnerability Management** – Scan container images for known
  vulnerabilities.
- **Runtime Security** – Detect and block suspicious activities in running
  containers.
- **Compliance Monitoring** – Ensure workloads align with security frameworks
  such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and NIST.
- **Policy-Driven Security** – Enforce rules for image usage, network traffic,
  and container runtime behavior.

> ACS ensures that security is not an afterthought but a built-in capability of
> the OpenShift platform.

## OpenShift Virtualization

This feature enables organizations to **run virtual machines (VMs) alongside
containers** on the same OpenShift platform. It allows seamless migration from
traditional virtualization solutions such as VMware, reducing costs and
simplifying management.

- **VM-to-Container Transition** – Migrate workloads from VMs to containers.
- **Unified Management** – Manage VMs and containers with the same tooling.
- **Platform Consolidation** – Reduce infrastructure complexity and cost.
- **Scalability** – Use Kubernetes-native scaling for both VMs and containers.

## OpenShift GitOps

GitOps brings **declarative, version-controlled configuration** into cluster
management and application deployment. With OpenShift GitOps, powered by Argo
CD, teams can:

- Automate deployments from Git repositories.
- Roll back instantly using Git history.
- Ensure environment consistency across multiple clusters.
- Enable developer self-service with automated workflows.

## OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF)

For data-intensive workloads, OpenShift Data Foundation provides a
**software-defined storage solution** integrated directly into the platform.

- **Persistent Storage for Containers** – Scale storage as applications demand.
- **Multi-Cloud Data Management** – Access data across hybrid environments.
- **Backup & Recovery** – Protect workloads with integrated data services.
- **Support for AI/ML Workloads** – Provide reliable storage for data pipelines.

## Summary

OpenShift is not just a container platform – it is an **enterprise application
platform**. With ACM, ACS, Virtualization, GitOps, and ODF, it provides
end-to-end capabilities for **management, security, modernization, and
automation** across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

These modules enable organizations to confidently run critical workloads while
maintaining agility, governance, and resilience.
