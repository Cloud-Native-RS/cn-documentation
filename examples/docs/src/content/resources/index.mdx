# Overview

This page brings together key resources about OpenShift and its extended
capabilities. Instead of simply listing links, the goal is to give a structured
overview of knowledge areas and why they matter. Each category highlights
concepts, best practices, and official documentation that can help you explore
the platform in depth.

---

## OpenShift Core

At the foundation, OpenShift provides a container orchestration platform built
on Kubernetes, enriched with enterprise features such as developer tooling,
integrated CI/CD, and hardened security defaults.  
Resources in this category cover the essentials:

- **OpenShift Documentation** – The official Red Hat knowledge base with
  step-by-step guides.  
- **Kubernetes Concepts** – Understanding pods, services, deployments, and
  operators.  
- **Architecture Overviews** – How OpenShift builds on Kubernetes and extends
  it with a developer and operator experience.

---

## Deployment Models

Organizations run OpenShift in different environments depending on business and
regulatory needs.  
Resources help you understand:

- **On-Premises OpenShift** – Running OpenShift in a private datacenter,
  providing full control and data sovereignty.  
- **Cloud-Hosted OpenShift** – Leveraging managed services from providers such
  as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.  
- **Hybrid & Multi-Cloud** – Strategies for distributing workloads across
  multiple infrastructures.

---

## Management and Governance

As environments scale, **management consistency** becomes critical.  
Key resources include:

- **Advanced Cluster Management (ACM)** – Tools for multi-cluster management,
  governance, and policy enforcement.  
- **Disaster Recovery and Backup** – Approaches for resilience across
  clusters.  
- **Compliance Standards** – Guidance on aligning with frameworks like PCI,
  HIPAA, and NIST.

---

## Security and Compliance

Security must be embedded into every stage of the application lifecycle.  
Resources here focus on:

- **Advanced Cluster Security (ACS)** – Image scanning, runtime monitoring, and
  compliance checks.  
- **Zero-Trust Architectures** – Applying least privilege and strong identity
  models inside OpenShift.  
- **Policy-Driven Workflows** – Enforcing rules and automating responses to
  risks.

---

## Modernization and Virtualization

Many organizations are modernizing legacy infrastructure by consolidating
workloads:

- **OpenShift Virtualization** – Running VMs and containers together on a
  single platform.  
- **Migration Guides** – Best practices for moving from VMware or other
  hypervisors.  
- **Consolidation Strategies** – Reducing operational complexity by
  centralizing workloads.

---

## Automation and GitOps

Automation enables faster and more reliable deployments.  
Resources in this area highlight:

- **OpenShift GitOps (Argo CD)** – Using Git as a single source of truth for
  infrastructure and application deployments.  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Applying Ansible, Terraform, and
  Operators to manage infrastructure.  
- **Continuous Deployment Practices** – Streamlining workflows from code to
  production.

---

## Data and Storage

Applications increasingly rely on reliable, scalable data services.  
Resources here include:

- **OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF)** – A cloud-native storage solution for
  containers.  
- **Persistent Volumes and Claims** – Understanding Kubernetes-native storage
  patterns.  
- **AI/ML Data Pipelines** – Supporting analytics and machine learning
  workloads.

---

## Learning and Community

Building knowledge and connecting with the community is essential:

- **Red Hat Learning Portal** – Official training and certifications.  
- **Cloud Native Community** – Kubernetes and OpenShift user groups.  
- **Events & Conferences** – Red Hat Summit, KubeCon, and local meetups.

---

## Summary

The **Resources** section serves as a curated map of where to start and how to
go deeper. From foundational concepts to advanced features like ACM, ACS,
Virtualization, GitOps, and ODF, each category opens a pathway into the
enterprise application platform that OpenShift has become.

By following these categories, you can move step by step—from learning the
basics, through scaling governance, to modernizing with automation and hybrid
cloud operations.
