# Introduction

Welcome to the Cloud Native internal documentation. This documentation is designed as a single 
source of truth for our teams, helping us build, deliver, and maintain cloud-native 
solutions with efficiency, clarity, and consistency. Our goal is to provide an organized 
knowledge base that reduces onboarding time, minimizes uncertainty, and enables 
all contributors—whether they are in sales, deployment, or operations—to work 
with a shared understanding of how we approach projects.


## Quick start

To start using Nextra, you need to select a theme first:

<Cards num={2}>
  <Cards.Card arrow title="Sales Documentation" href="/docs/docs-theme/start">
    <>![Documentation theme screenshot](/assets/docs-theme.png)</>
  </Cards.Card>
  <Cards.Card arrow title="Engineering Documentation" href="/docs/blog-theme/start">
    <>![Blog theme screenshot](/assets/blog-theme.png)</>
  </Cards.Card>
</Cards>


## Purpose of This Documentation

The cloud-native ecosystem is complex and fast-moving, with technologies, best practices, and customer expectations evolving rapidly. To succeed, we need more than just tools and platforms—we need a clear, structured way of working. This documentation provides:

- **Guidance for daily work** by offering concrete processes and playbooks.  
- **Shared language and alignment** so teams can communicate without ambiguity.  
- **Reference materials and resources** that make it easy to revisit critical concepts and decisions.  
- **Onboarding support** to quickly bring new colleagues and partners up to speed.  

By centralizing our knowledge, we make it easier to scale our organization, support customers consistently, and maintain a culture of learning and collaboration.

## Scope of the Documentation

This documentation covers the entire lifecycle of our cloud-native initiatives, organized into four main categories:

### Sales
The Sales section explains how we present our expertise to clients. It includes value propositions, positioning statements, and solution blueprints that highlight the business outcomes our platforms deliver. It also covers sales processes, qualification criteria, and communication guidelines that help us create trust and long-term relationships with customers.

### Deployment
The Deployment section provides detailed guidance on rolling out cloud-native platforms and services. Here, you will find methodologies for environment setup, architecture design, integration strategies, and automation approaches. Deployment is not just about technical execution—it is about ensuring that our clients’ platforms are reliable, scalable, and tailored to their needs from the very beginning.

### Operations
The Operations section focuses on running and maintaining cloud-native systems once they are in production. This includes monitoring and observability practices, incident response, platform upgrades, and lifecycle management. Strong operations are what make our solutions sustainable over time, ensuring stability, security, and predictable performance for customers.

### Resources
The Resources section provides supporting materials that connect and strengthen the other areas. It contains templates, reference guides, technical checklists, and external documentation links. This is the space where best practices are stored and easily accessible, making it possible for all teams to reuse proven approaches rather than starting from scratch.

## Who This Documentation is For

This documentation is written for everyone in the organization who interacts with cloud-native projects. That includes:

- **Sales teams** who need to position our solutions effectively.  
- **Architects and engineers** responsible for design and deployment.  
- **Operations and support teams** who keep platforms healthy and resilient.  
- **New team members** who want to get a structured introduction into our way of working.  
- **Partners and collaborators** who need a consistent point of reference when working alongside us.  

No matter your role, this documentation aims to give you both high-level orientation and detailed instructions where needed.

## Moving Forward

The documentation is a living resource. It will evolve as our practices mature, as new technologies enter our stack, and as our clients’ needs change. Everyone is encouraged to contribute improvements, whether that means clarifying a process, adding a missing step, or sharing a new best practice.  

By building this body of knowledge together, we ensure that our organization is not only aligned internally but also ready to meet the challenges of the rapidly changing cloud-native landscape.

This Introduction page is your entry point. From here, we encourage you to explore the dedicated sections on **Sales**, **Deployment**, **Operations**, and **Resources**, which go into greater detail on each aspect of our work. Together, these sections provide the foundation for how we deliver cloud-native value at scale.

## FAQ

The Nextra FAQ is a collection of useful questions and answers about the
project. If you have a question that isn't answered here, please

<details>
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <summary>Can I use Nextra with Next.js `pages` router?</summary>
Nextra 4 only works with the `app` router. Only Nextra 1/2/3 supports the
`pages` router.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I use X with Nextra?</summary>
The answer is "yes" for most things. Since Nextra is just a Next.js plugin, almost all the things
that can be done with React can be done with Nextra. Here are some examples and guides:

- [Use Tailwind CSS](/docs/guide/tailwind-css)
- [Use custom CSS and Sass](/docs/guide/custom-css)
- [Use custom fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization)

  <summary>How can I add a live coding component in Nextra?</summary>
There are libraries like [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io) and
[react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live) that can help you
add live coding components to your MDX.
